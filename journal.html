Entry I | 10.11.2019:
Today marked the rough completion of the hub website which will link in some way to all of my code. It was a pretty routine job, but it got a little complicated after I added a background image to to the website. As a result, it looks really nice, but was definitely a little difficult. The website also links to all of my projects, and it has a bar on the side which shows the dates on which the projects were completed. For the future, I think that it would behoove me to try to make my designs a little more cohesive, as they tended to be a little abstract through my mock-ups and drafts of the eventual design.

Today I worked on trying to think of potential ways to transform the currently vacant room on the 14th floor. While I initially struggled with figuring out how to code things, I eventually was able to work past these various hardcomings to almost succeed in my task--I will continue throughout the week to work on it.</section>

Entry III | 10.22.2019:
Today we met with the Kindergarteners and got to know them a little bit. They all are very interested in the ocean, and know a lot about it as well. As we are going to be coding things for these little kids, it makes sense for me to do something that revolves around the ocean, as it will be quite interesting to them.</section>
