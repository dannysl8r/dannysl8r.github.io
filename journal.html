Entry I | 10.11.2019:
Today marked the rough completion of the hub website which will link in some way to all of my code. It was a pretty routine job, but it got a little complicated after I added a background image to to the website. As a result, it looks really nice, but was definitely a little difficult. The website also links to all of my projects, and it has a bar on the side which shows the dates on which the projects were completed. For the future, I think that it would behoove me to try to make my designs a little more cohesive, as they tended to be a little abstract through my mock-ups and drafts of the eventual design.
